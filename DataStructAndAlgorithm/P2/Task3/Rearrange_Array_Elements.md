# Task 3: Rearrange Array Elements

### Explanation of code
Finding the max sum of the two numbers consist of array elements. First, we sort the array from large to small. Then, we get each element from the start to the end separetly for the two numbers.

### Time and Space Complexity Analysis
The time space complexity for this program is O(nlog(n)) because we find half amount each time. The space complexity is O(n).
