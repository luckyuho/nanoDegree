# Task 7: HTTPRouter using a Trie

### Explanation of code
Simulation of router of http request. Building trie node.

### Time and Space Complexity Analysis
The modular time complexity of RouteTrieNode is O(1). The worst modular time complexity of RouteTrie and Router is O(n). The best modular time complexity of RouteTrie and Router is O(1). The average modular time complexity of RouteTrie and Router is O(log(n)). The space complexity is O(1).
