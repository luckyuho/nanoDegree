# Task 5: Autocomplete with Tries

### Explanation of code
Build trie and trie node and find the suffixes. 

### Time and Space Complexity Analysis
The modular time complexity of TrieNode is O(1). The worst modular time complexity of Trie is O(n). The best modular time complexity of Trie is O(1). The average modular time complexity of Trie is O(log(n)). The space complexity is O(1).
